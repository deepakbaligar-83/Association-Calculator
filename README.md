## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

To run the project there are some steps you need to follow before npm start. The app uses environment variables so you need a mongodb key and a port key to run the app.


After that you will need "npm install" and then you are ready to go. But remember that you need to npm install inside the server once and inside the client once as these two are running on different ports.


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

*server* <br> 
1- cd to the server and press "npm i" <br> 
2- setup a mongodb key instead of the one already there. <br> 
3- choose your own port. <br> 
4- you can now npm start the server <br> 

*client* <br> 
1- cd to the client and press "npm i" <br> 
2- according to continuous updates running along the npm packages you may find a package that needs an update or a differen syntax to run properly.<br> 
3- run npm start and the client side is ready to go <br>
